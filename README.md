Interactive Fiction game made using Twine, 11 September 2021

This is an Interactive Fiction game based on one of my favorite movies "Alien."
You are Ellen Ripley and you must escape the Nostromo before encountering the dreaded Xenomorph.
There are multiple choices that lead to a few different endings.
